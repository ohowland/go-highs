Go bindings for HiGHs linear optimization software

# references
This library references the work done at by Scott Pakin (www.github.com/lanl/clp). Many if not all the techniques are taken directly from the lanl/clp codebase.

Thank you HiGHS team (https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS) for releasing the library.
